1. What is the difference between automated and manual testing in software development?
Manual Testing:
Definition: Manual testing involves human testers executing test cases without the use of automation tools. Testers manually interact with the application to find defects.
Process: Includes steps such as writing test cases, manually running tests, observing outcomes, and logging defects.
Advantages:
Flexibility in exploratory testing.
Better for testing user interfaces and user experiences.
Useful for ad-hoc testing.
Disadvantages:
Time-consuming and labor-intensive.
Prone to human error.
Not scalable for large projects.
Inconsistent test coverage.
Automated Testing:
Definition: Automated testing uses software tools and scripts to run tests automatically, checking the application's functionality.
Process: Involves creating test scripts, running them automatically, and comparing actual outcomes with expected results.
Advantages:
Faster execution of repetitive tests.
More reliable and consistent.
Reusable test scripts.
Scalable for large projects.
Better suited for regression testing.
Disadvantages:
Initial setup and maintenance can be costly and time-consuming.
Requires programming knowledge.
Not as flexible for exploratory testing.

3. What is Cross Browser Testing?
Cross Browser Testing:
Definition: A type of testing to ensure that a web application works as expected across different browsers and devices.
Purpose: To identify and fix browser-specific issues to provide a consistent user experience.
Challenges:
Different browsers render HTML and CSS differently.
JavaScript execution can vary.
Browser versions and device compatibility.
Tools:
BrowserStack: Provides cloud-based cross-browser testing.
Sauce Labs: Offers a wide range of browser and device combinations for testing.
CrossBrowserTesting: Supports live testing, automated testing, and visual testing across multiple browsers and devices.

4. Write a Blog on TDD and BDD
Test-Driven Development (TDD):
Definition: A software development approach where tests are written before writing the actual code.
Process:
Write a test for a new feature.
Run the test and see it fail (since the feature isn't implemented yet).
Write the minimum code necessary to pass the test.
Refactor the code while ensuring the test still passes.
Repeat for new features.
Advantages:
Ensures high test coverage.
Leads to better-designed, cleaner, and more reliable code.
Early bug detection.
Disadvantages:
Can be time-consuming initially.
Requires developers to think about testing from the start.
Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):
Definition: An extension of TDD, focusing on the behavior of an application from the end user's perspective.
Process:
Write user stories or scenarios in plain language.
Convert these stories into automated tests.
Implement the code to pass the tests.
Refactor the code while keeping the tests passing.
Tools: Cucumber, SpecFlow, JBehave.
Advantages:
Encourages collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders.
Tests are written in a language that non-technical stakeholders can understand.
Ensures that the software meets user requirements.
Disadvantages:
Can be challenging to write good scenarios.
Requires investment in training and tooling.
